If you have any questions about using the code, please contact Yuhao Feng (fengyuhao@pku.edu.cn)

If you use this algorithm, please cite the article entiled "L1-Tree: A novel algorithm for constructing 3D tree models and estimating branch architectural traits using terrestrial laser scanning data"

The point cloud data of the 24 trees mentioned in the article were in the Data folder, and the 3D models of these trees were in the Results folder

You can easily get 3D models of the abovementioned 24 trees by adjusting the parameter "fileName" in the Main.m file. Additionally, you can obtain your own 3D tree model by placing the point cloud file in the Data folder and adjusting the Main.m file as instructed
